        <h1>PhisX Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>PhisX is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle the data collected by the PhisX Chrome extension.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Collection and Use</strong></p>
        <p>PhisX processes URLs from the websites you visit to detect and block phishing attempts. The extension sends the active tab's URL to our secure server where it is analyzed using machine learning algorithms. The results are then returned to the extension to determine whether the site is potentially dangerous. PhisX does not store, share, or sell any URL data or other user information.</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
        <p>PhisX does not use cookies or any other tracking technologies. Our extension focuses solely on analyzing URLs in real-time for phishing detection and does not track or store any user behavior data.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Storage</strong></p>
        <p>PhisX does not store any data on our servers or in the cloud. All analysis is performed in real-time, and once a URL has been analyzed, it is discarded and not retained in any form.</p>

        <p><strong>Third-Party Sharing</strong></p>
        <p>PhisX does not share your data with any third parties. The extension is designed to operate with a strong commitment to user privacy and data protection. The only external interaction involves the analysis of URLs by our machine learning model, with no data storage or sharing.</p>

        <p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
        <p>PhisX requires certain permissions to function, such as access to the active tab. These permissions are necessary for PhisX to analyze URLs in real-time and provide accurate phishing detection. We do not use these permissions for any other purpose.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your data when it is being processed by our extension. This includes encryption and secure communication protocols. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <p><strong>User Rights</strong></p>
        <p>You have the right to request access to the data we process about you, request corrections, or request deletion of your data. Since PhisX does not store any user data, these rights are generally not applicable, but we are committed to addressing any concerns you might have.</p>

        <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>
        <p>By using the PhisX Chrome extension, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>

        <p><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong></p>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review the policy periodically.</p>
